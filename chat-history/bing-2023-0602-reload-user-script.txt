I am writing a tampermonkey script (.user.js) which is running on Chrome and Edge.
The common practice of reloading the updated tampermonkey script is by refreshing the page.
But I would like to implement this update behavior by clicking a button on the page.
Please do following steps based on my problem:
[1] Analyze the possibilities of implement this feature.
[2] Provide several solutions and analyze it.
[3] Choose the best solution and implement it.


OK. Then let's consider another workaround.
Since it is hard to implement the feature of reloading the updated tampermonkey script without refreshing the page, let's try the solution of click a button or run a command in console, to remove the original element with its bound functions, and then add the modified element with modified functions again.

Then let's move forward through this solution path.
Please do following steps:
[1] List several related features and functions that we can use to implement this workaround.
[2] Provide corresponding code snippets.
[3] After finishing the above steps, please provide three questions which could dive deeper in enhancing the feature, and three questions which could move further on this task.

Great! Answer following questions one by one:
[1] How can we integrate this workaround into a Tampermonkey script?
[2] How can we trigger this workaround using a button click or console command?
[3] How can we test and debug this workaround to ensure it works as expected?
